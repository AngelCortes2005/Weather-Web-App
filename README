# Web Project

This is a simple web project.

## Requirements

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed.

## How to Run

1. Open the project folder in **VS Code**.
2. Press **Ctrl + F5** (or **Cmd + F5** on Mac) to run without debugging.

> This will launch your default browser and open the project if it's properly configured.

## Alternative (Static HTML Projects)

If nothing happens:

- Install the **Live Server** extension from the VS Code Marketplace.
- Right-click on your `index.html` file and choose **"Open with Live Server"**.

## Notes

- No build step or compilation is required unless specified.
- Make sure your `index.html` is in the root folder (or adjust accordingly).
