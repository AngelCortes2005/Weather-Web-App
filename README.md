# Web Project

In this project I build a weather app that displays the current weather details based on the location entered by the user.

## Requirements

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed.

## How to Run

1. Open the project folder in **VS Code**.
2. Press **Ctrl + F5** (or **Cmd + F5** on Mac) to run without debugging.

> This will launch your default browser and open the project if it's properly configured.
